## POINTS: 0
## KEY: Good start, but web service endpoints do not do what was expected. Remember for REST web services we use the different HTTP message actions to do create/POST, read/GET, update/PUT, delete/DELETE.

# Express CRUD classwork

Reference here for sample data: https://pokedex.org/#/

### This classwork is in 2 parts.

## Part 1:
Implement the endpoints necessary to support the included POSTMAN test cases

## Part 2:
Add the endpoints and logic needed to support the generic views for list all, add, view,edit and delete Pokemon from the Pokedex

## Challenge 
Complete the needed PUG template improvements and wire all the pages together.
